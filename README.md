🛒 Zepto SQL Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end SQL data analysis workflow using a Zepto-inspired quick-commerce inventory dataset. The objective of this analysis is to simulate real-world data analyst tasks performed in e-commerce and retail environments to extract meaningful business insights.
