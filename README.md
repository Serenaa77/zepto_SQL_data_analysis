🛒 Zepto SQL Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end SQL data analysis workflow using a Zepto-inspired quick-commerce inventory dataset. The objective of this analysis is to simulate how data analysts work with real-world e-commerce or retail datasets to extract meaningful business insights.
